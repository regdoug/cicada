# Project CiCADA

Project CiCADA is an experiment to design an inexpensive interactive 3D display.
It was developed by Mike Rodriguez as part of his Masters degree in Manufacturing
and Mechanical Systems Integration at Rochester Institute of Technology

## Code

Firmware code for the Arduino Mega 2560 that interfaces with the hardware is in
the `arduino` folder.

In the `python` folder, the `cicada` module provides an abstract interface to the
hardware.  The example applications provided use the `cicada` module.

## CAD

SolidWorks, STEP, and STL files are provided in the `cad` folder. The prototype
was printed on a Stratasys U-Print and a Stratasys (something else...)

## Licensing

Code under the `arduino` and `python` folder is licensed under GPLv3.
Solid models are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY 3.0).
